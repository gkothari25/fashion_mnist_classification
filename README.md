# Classification of fashion mnist data :- 

https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.
Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. We intend Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in 
replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

# Code details :-
Solved this image classification problem using computer vision. Used Convolutional neural network (CNN)/Deep learning/AI to solve this problem.
Programming language - Python3
Deep learning Framework - Tensorflow backend and Keras api
Two jupyter Notebooks are available in this repo :- One for CNN only model and other one for Dense layer only model.

# My Experiment :- 
Used 5000 images for the training set and 1500 images for the validation set and 10000 images for the test set.
500 images per class.
# Result :- 
Trained the model from scratch and result are following:- 
1 - Achieved an accuracy of 88% in the test set with 4 CNN layer model and 1 dense layer only.
2-  Achieved an accuracy of 76% in the test set with 5 Dense layer only.

# Observation - key points for reducing overfitting :-
Batchnorm layer, 
Droupout layer, 
Image generator of diff shape, rotation and shear, 
Simple model with fewer parameter
A good split of train and validation set.

# Future scope ï¿½
Trying to achieve an accuray close to 95% without transfer learning and with only 5000 training samples.
